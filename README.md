# Todo-List

Todo-List APP

A simple application used to create and manage everyday todos built with html, JavaScript, and pure CSS.

# Project Status

This project is currently in development. Users may create and manage their todos but the data has to be persisted somewhere (which is not the case currently) - therefore I'm planning to hook it up with Firebase in the near future.

# Reflection

This was a 1 week long project built during my front-end web development bootcamp at Re-coded. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point.
